🔍 Overview  
This project focuses on building an **AI-Powered Study Planner** using Java that helps students organize their study schedules efficiently.
The system leverages **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** techniques to analyze subjects, difficulty levels, available time, and deadlines in order to create personalized timetables.  

By integrating intelligent recommendations, reminders, and progress tracking, the system enhances time management, reduces stress, and improves academic performance. The planner adapts dynamically to changes in a student’s schedule, providing an interactive and user-friendly platform for effective study planning.
